            <p>Hello! My name is Maria Cortez, I am a 23-year-old Graphic Designer from Lima, Peru. My birthday is on April 1<sup>st</sup>. I studied for 5 years at the <i>Peruvian University of Applied Sciences</i> <abbr title="Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas">(UPC)</abbr> and graduated by the end of 2020 as a Bachelor in Graphic Design. Currently, I am working remotely as a part-time graphic designer at an agency in New York.</p>
            
            <p>I like watching movies and tv shows, especially musical comedies and animated films from Disney. I also enjoy listening to different genres of music in order to increase my Spotify playlist. I find relaxing riding my bike in the afternoons when is fresh, even though I am not a very sporty person.</p>
